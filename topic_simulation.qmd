Covers best practices for simulation studies in the first lecture, then bootstrap and permutation tests in the second lecture

- [Simulation studies](what_is_ds_i.qmd)
- [Resampling methods for statistical inference](what_is_ds_ii.qmd)
- [Parallelization, parametric reports](what_is_ds_ii.qmd)


A couple of papers I highly recommend reading on these topics are:

- [Using simulation studies to evaluate statistical methods](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6492164/) 
- [Bootstrap](literature/hesterberg_bootstrap.pdf)
