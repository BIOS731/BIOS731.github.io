This paper on [good enough practices](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510) for scientific computing gives an idea of what we want to achieve in this course, and why we want to achieve it.

Also, check out this [editorial](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2024.2340557) I co-wrote as one of the Associate Editor's for Reproducibility at JASA. It describes the JASA reproducibility process.
