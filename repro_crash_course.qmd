In this, we will cover basic topics in reproducible computing, including coding style, project organization, and git/GitHub.

### Lab: CDC open data

The CDC has over 1300 open-source datasets available at [data.cdc.gov](https://data.cdc.gov/).

- Topic areas include injury & violence, vaccination, smoking,pregnancy, chronic disease, and disease surveillance
- Great source of Covid surveillance data
- [data.gov](https://data.gov/) hosts additional 250K+ datasets

The [**Covid Wastewater dataset**](https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html#about-data) comes from the National Wastewater Surveillance System(NWSS) Public SARS-CoV-2 Concentration in Wastewater Data.

- Contains SARS-CoV-2 concentration at different sampling locations across the U.S.
- Update Daily

There are two available datasets:
  
1. Longitudinal data, which has four columns and provides concentrations over time
2. Cross-sectional data, which includes current concentration and other summaries, as well as information about state, county (16 total columns)

Our goal is to produce an end-to-end reproducible workflow with this data. We will do the following:

1. Download the data directly into R by interacting with the CDC API.
2. Clean the data: Longitudinal data contains concentrations over time,and cross-sectional data contains information about county each data collection site is located in. We will merge these two datasets and subset to collection sites in Georgia only.
3. Analyze data.
4. Visualize data.

Pull these steps together into a documented reproducible report.


#### 1: Create final report


I've done most of these steps for us already by creating an example project folder. Download it [here](labs/example_project.zip).

- Download and unzip this folder
- Check out the files in the `source` subfolder. What are each of these doing?
- Build a `final_report` Quarto or R Markdown document that calls each of the steps of the data analysis, and explains what is being done at each step.
- As you make changes to the project, commit changes using `git`.
- Feel free to add some of your own visualizations.

#### 2: Upload to GitHub

- Push your finished project to GitHub
- Clone one of your classmate's repos and try to run their final report document. Was it fully reproducible?
