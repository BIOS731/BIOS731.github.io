## Course Description

This course, designed for Ph.D. biostatistics students, dives into the methods and applications of essential statistical computing techniques. Students will achieve two key goals:  
1. Master the implementation of algorithms behind widely used statistical models  
2. Build fluency in reproducible statistical programming  

With a focus on practical implementation, the course balances foundational theory with hands-on computational experience. Topics include random number generation, bootstrap methods, optimization techniques, Expectation-Maximization (EM), Minorization-Maximization (MM), and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). On the programming side, students will explore simulation design, cluster computing, code profiling, parallelization, and R package development.

This course requires a significant amount of programming. Class examples and homework assignments will be predominantly in **R**. Because R can be relatively slow, students will learn how to optimize R for computational efficiency through code profiling and parallelization, and how to implement faster C++ backends using **Rcpp**.

For standard algorithms such as Newton–Raphson, EM, iteratively reweighted least squares, and Gibbs sampling, homework assignments will require students to directly implement the algorithm rather than use existing software packages. For more advanced topics—including ADMM, variational inference, and deep learning—assignments will focus on reading and summarizing journal articles and performing analyses using existing software.

The final project allows students to apply tools learned in class to topics related to their dissertation research.

**Prerequisites:** BIOS 707, BIOS 709, or permission of the instructor.

The course will make heavy use of matrix algebra, including vector and matrix derivatives, norms, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and matrix inverses.

R is required for homework assignments unless otherwise specified.

## Course Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of the course, students should be able to:

- Understand the theoretical and computational foundations of algorithms covered in the course  
- Implement algorithms using high-level programming languages  
- Apply methods to real-world data  
- Write efficient, reproducible R code locally and on computing clusters  

### PhD Competency Assessed

- **Develop and assess new statistical methods**  
  - Homework 1 involves designing and implementing a simulation study.

- **Conduct complex statistical analyses**  
  - The final project applies a recent computational method to a real dataset.

- **Conduct independent research in biostatistics**  
  - The final exam involves reading a research paper and implementing the proposed method.

## Evaluation

Evaluation will be based on the following components:

| Assessment                         | Percentage |
|-----------------------------------|------------|
| Homework (7 assignments)          | 50%        |
| Final Project and Presentation    | 30%        |
| Discussion Board (4 posts)        | 10%        |
| Participation                     | 10%        |

### Grading Scale

| Grade | Percentage | Points |
|------|------------|--------|
| A    | 93–100%    | 4.0    |
| A−   | 90–93%     | 3.7    |

## Homework (50%)

Homework must be neat, well organized, and typed. Raw computer output is not acceptable. Numerical output should be incorporated into text or tables, and plots must be clearly labeled.

Students may collaborate, but submitted work must be their own and not identical to others.

Late assignments receive a maximum of half credit. Assignments more than three days late will not be graded.

---

## Participation (10%)

Students are expected to attend class in person. Participation credit requires attendance and engagement in at least 20 lectures through asking or answering questions.

---

## Final Project and Presentation (30%)

Students will select a computational method from the past five years, apply it to a dataset, and present results to the class.

| Component            | Weight |
|----------------------|--------|
| Written report       | 50%    |
| In-class presentation| 50%    |

---

## Discussion Board (10%)

Four discussion posts based on readings and/or seminar lectures.

---

## Course Structure

This course meets in person twice weekly. The first half of each class is lecture-based, and the second half focuses on problem-solving in small groups.
