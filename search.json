    "section": "Course Description",
    "text": "Course Description\nThis course, designed for Ph.D. biostatistics students, dives into the methods and applications of essential statistical computing techniques. Students will achieve two key goals:\n1. Master the implementation of algorithms behind widely used statistical models\n2. Build fluency in reproducible statistical programming\nWith a focus on practical implementation, the course balances foundational theory with hands-on computational experience. Topics include random number generation, bootstrap methods, optimization techniques, Expectation-Maximization (EM), Minorization-Maximization (MM), and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). On the programming side, students will explore simulation design, cluster computing, code profiling, parallelization, and R package development.\nThis course requires a significant amount of programming. Class examples and homework assignments will be predominantly in R. Because R can be relatively slow, students will learn how to optimize R for computational efficiency through code profiling and parallelization, and how to implement faster C++ backends using Rcpp.\nFor standard algorithms such as Newton–Raphson, EM, iteratively reweighted least squares, and Gibbs sampling, homework assignments will require students to directly implement the algorithm rather than use existing software packages. For more advanced topics—including ADMM, variational inference, and deep learning—assignments will focus on reading and summarizing journal articles and performing analyses using existing software.\nThe final project allows students to apply tools learned in class to topics related to their dissertation research.\nPrerequisites: BIOS 707, BIOS 709, or permission of the instructor.\nThe course will make heavy use of matrix algebra, including vector and matrix derivatives, norms, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and matrix inverses.\nR is required for homework assignments unless otherwise specified."
